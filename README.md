ðŸŒ€ Non-linear Classification with PyTorch

This project shows why non-linear activations are crucial in neural networks using the classic make_circles dataset.

ðŸ”‘ Key Points

Decision Boundary: The border where the model switches between classes.

Model V1: Only linear layers â†’ fails (can only learn straight lines).

Model V2: Linear + ReLU â†’ learns curved boundaries, fits circles.

Loss: BCEWithLogitsLoss for stable binary classification.

ðŸ“Š Result

Linear-only model underfits.

Non-linear model successfully separates concentric circles.
